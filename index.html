                <h3>Who I am.</h3>
                <p>I have over 8 years of experience producing a wide range of digital and print media projects. I specialize in brand identity, 
                  photography, frontend development, and account management.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bridging the gap between creatives and clients allows me to translate communications in both directions. My experience and
                  skillset allows me to bring a unqiue perspective to creative enviorments. I can paint a picture for CEO's or get my hands dirty and 
                  produce the work myself. 
                </p>
                <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                <p>
                    "I worked very closely with Jeff, Creative Director, GM at the time for the Midtown studio, first Atlanta location through my focus 
                    in business development, sales, marketing, building partnerships and alliances. Jeff trained me on print and graphic design in 
                    Savannah in January, 2015 and when the Atlanta studio opened in July through the end of my engagement in September. We worked 
                    collaboratively with prospective clients and opportunities I brought to Jeff and team, whether corporate, entrepreneurial, 
                    non-profit or university. Jeff is a strategic and tactical thinker; creative in both the art form; and, with written word and 
                    concepts; is fast on his feet both in thinking, "outside the box" and "in the box" where necessary. He's a chameleon and can 
                    work with all kinds of people in many different situations always making the client as best he could, feel special and valued."
